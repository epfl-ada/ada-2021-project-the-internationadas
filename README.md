## Abstract

## Research Questions

## Proposet Additional Datasets

## Methods

## ðŸ’» Setup
To get started, it is necessary to install the `requirements.txt`.
As even our transformed and filtered dataset is relatively large, we did not include it in the repo. Instead, we'd like to ask you to download it from our [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Pi9XV9RcRePrITCkfHs8njhgbE0YbsIy?usp=sharing)
Simply put the compressed JSON file into the `data` folder. In case you don't want to re-execute the data analysis pipeline, you can skip the step of manually adding the dataset. As we committed precompiled Jupyter Notebooks, you can already get an idea of our data pipeline by studying them.
The overall structure should look like this:
```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ data
